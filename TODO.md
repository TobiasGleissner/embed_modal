# Features
* more consequence types
* TH1 support
* more constant types

# Misc
* parser grammar: Full THF compliance
* more documentation
* check if there are already any identifiers which are used in the embedding meta-symbols
* better logging and provide more useful information for the user
* embedding of problems not containing modal operators
* Check embedding for thf sentences containing the definition role

# Mixed Modal Logics
* test and explore mixed semantics e.g. ```$quantification = [$constant, $i := varying]```

# Multiple Modalities
* test all already implemented aspects of multimodal logics
* support and explore cumulative and decreasing domains
* support and explore S5U support

# Code Quality
* remove suffixrelation and replace by relation where possible
* introduce type/relation/modaloperator classes

# Unit Tests
* semantics analysis
* untested operators

# Other Tests
* set up CI
* automate QMLTP testing with some tool
